# Business Analytics Projects

Welcome to my business analytics projects portfolio. Here, you will find a collection of business analytics projects that I completed during my 2-month Business Analyst experience program with 'Finaltics'. In this program, I had access to learning resources for business analysis and was presented with case studies by my instructor. I utilized BI tools like Excel and Power BI to solve these cases. This repository showcases a selection of the projects completed during the program (Program certificate available in my repository).

## Descriptions:

### Stores Excel Project
I analyzed data from various stores in Delhi, Chennai, Mumbai, and Kolkata. The dataset included store details such as codes, names, types, locations, operating costs, and staff counts. After downloading the Excel file, I created pivot tables and charts to visualize total sales, operating costs, profit percent, acquisition percent, and staff count based on store types and locations. I customized these charts using elements, styles, and colors to enhance clarity and detail.

### Netflix Excel Project
Engaging with a Netflix dataset, I explored diverse subscription prices categorized by countries and subscription types (Basic, Standard, Premium). I downloaded the Excel file and skillfully constructed pivot tables to dissect key variables like TV shows, movies, and costs. My data visualization skills came into play as I curated Clustered column and Pie charts, enhancing their visual appeal with customized elements. Further analysis led me to dimensions like standard and premium costs, with chart modifications for a comprehensive overview of subscription patterns and pricing across different countries.

### IMDB Power BI Project
I embarked on the IMDb Rating Dataset encompassing movie ratings from 2006 to 2016, categorized by Title, Genre, Directors, Actors, Year, Runtime, Rating, Votes, and Revenue. Starting by loading the data onto Power BI, I meticulously transformed it, eliminating Description and Metascore columns. Refining the dataset involved removing blank entries and errors across columns. Employing creative visualization, I crafted Line and Clustered Column Charts, customized to depict Genre and Rank, Title and Revenue (in violet), and Title and Total Votes. These visuals seamlessly integrated into a unified dashboard, refined with consistent formatting, color themes, and fonts for a cohesive and insightful analysis.
